# Go with Flow

A local-first productivity tracker and daily command center for developers and students.

---

## Why I Built This

I built Go with Flow because I wanted a fast, distraction-free dashboard to manage daily habits, track LeetCode and Codeforces problem practice, and do focused deep-work sessions—without paying for subscriptions or storing personal routines on third-party servers.

Most productivity web apps require a hosted database and backend API. When deployed on free hosting tiers (such as Render or Railway), the backend sleeps after 15 minutes, resulting in 50–90 second cold-start delays every time you open the app on your phone.

Go with Flow solves this by running 100% local-first:
- **Zero backend cold-starts:** All tasks, coding logs, focus statistics, and routines live directly in your browser's persistent storage.
- **Serverless API proxies:** LeetCode and Codeforces synchronization is handled directly by Next.js serverless route handlers, avoiding CORS issues without needing a Python server.
- **Private multi-device backup:** Optionally back up encrypted snapshots directly into your personal Google Drive sandbox (`appDataFolder`) using Google OAuth.
- **Mobile PWA:** Installable as a native full-screen app on iOS and Android with offline caching.

## What It Does

### Coding Arena
- **52-Week Contribution Heatmap:** GitHub-style activity grid displaying consistency over 16 weeks, 26 weeks, or a full year.
- **LeetCode & Codeforces Auto-Sync:** Enter your handle to pull solved problems, difficulty breakdowns, and recent accepted submissions into your ledger.
- **Problem Logger:** Fast entry form for logging problems across LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, or custom contest links with editable logs.

### Deep Work Focus Timer
- **Pomodoro Engine:** Configurable work sprint intervals (15m, 25m, 50m, or custom duration).
- **Fullscreen Zen Mode:** Automatically fades away all navigation and controls on cursor idle so you can concentrate purely on the countdown.
- **Audio Hub:**
  - YouTube background player: paste any YouTube live stream or video (e.g. Lofi Girl, synthwave).
  - Curated lo-fi web radio and direct `.mp3` stream support.
  - Offline procedural synthesizer: generates Brownian noise, 10Hz binaural alpha brainwaves, and rain sounds using the Web Audio API without using network bandwidth.
- **Anti-Cheat XP:** Focus minutes and XP are only recorded when the timer naturally finishes (`00:00`).

### Tasks, Routines & Notes
- **Rule of 3 Focus:** Set three non-negotiable daily objectives to prevent decision fatigue.
- **Timetable Schedule:** Time-blocked routine tracker with live indicator chips (`Active Now`, `Starts at X`, `Pending`).
- **Calendar Date Picker:** Interactive month/year calendar widget for scheduling habit blocks and setting task due dates.
- **Backlog & Markdown Scratchpad:** Quick-capture checklist and persistent notes for daily thoughts.
- **Balanced XP Economy:** Completing tasks awards XP; unchecking them deducts the exact XP awarded.

### Appearance & Privacy
- **Themes & White Mode:** Toggle between Dark Cyberpunk and a clean, high-contrast Light/White mode, accompanied by 5 accent colors (Emerald, Cyan, Purple, Amber, Rose).
- **Google Drive Cloud Vault:** Save and restore your entire data snapshot to your private Google Drive app folder.
- **Reset Safety Gate:** Requires typing `DELETE ALL MY DATA` to purge local records.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-with-flow.git
   cd go-with-flow
   ```

2. Install dependencies and start the dev server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Deploying to Vercel

Because the application is serverless, there are no databases to provision or backend servers to manage.

---

## Installing on Mobile (PWA)

To run Go with Flow as a standalone mobile app:

- **iOS (Safari):** Open your Vercel URL in Safari → tap Share (`⎋`) → select **Add to Home Screen**.
- **Android (Chrome):** Open your Vercel URL in Chrome → tap the menu (`⋮`) → select **Install App** or **Add to Home Screen**.

The app works offline and launches full-screen like a native application.

---

## Google Drive Cloud Sync (Optional)

If you want cross-device backup between your laptop and phone:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a project and enable the **Google Drive API**.
3. Under **OAuth consent screen**, select **External** and add your Google account to test users.
4. Add the scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata`.
5. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (Web application type) and add your deployed Vercel domain and `http://localhost:3000` to **Authorized JavaScript origins**.
6. Add the Client ID to `frontend/.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```
7. In Vercel, add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` under **Project Settings > Environment Variables**.
